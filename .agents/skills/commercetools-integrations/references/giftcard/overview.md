# Gift card connector — integrate a gift card management system

This is the **gift card integration sub-area** of this skill: you want customers to pay with gift cards (or store credit / vouchers) at checkout, and you'll do it with a Connect connector that talks to a gift card management system. For the deep, type-agnostic build/publish/certify lifecycle and the production-readiness gate, that's the [commercetools-connect](../../../commercetools-connect/SKILL.md) skill; this sub-area owns the gift-card-specific shape end to end — from "is there a connector already?" through configuring, forking, or building one.

A gift card Connector manages the communication between the merchant, [Checkout](https://docs.commercetools.com/checkout/), and the gift card management system, exposing gift cards as a **payment method** in the checkout flow ([Gift card Connectors](https://docs.commercetools.com/checkout/connectors-and-applications.md#gift-card-connectors)). It supports checking a card's **balance** in real time, **applying** its value toward the purchase, **partial payments** (the card covers part of the total and another payment method covers the rest), and **multiple gift cards** on one transaction.

Like a payment connector, a gift card connector is **two applications** built from the [gift card integration template](https://github.com/commercetools/connect-giftcard-integration-template):

- **processor** (a `service`) — the backend middleware to the gift card system. It checks balances, redeems value, and **owns the commercetools Payment object** (creates it, adds/updates transactions). Its behavior is driven by its `connect.yaml` config; it authenticates callers with a Checkout Session (balance/redeem) or a JWT/OAuth token (post-order operations via the Payment Intents API).
- **enabler** (an `assets` bundle) — a browser JS library that renders the gift-card input UI and calls the processor. Checkout loads it based on your Payment Integration configuration; it can also be embedded directly in a custom frontend.

> **The rule to internalize first: never ship a gift card integration alone.** A gift card Payment Integration must always be configured **alongside at least one other Payment Integration** ([docs](https://docs.commercetools.com/checkout/connectors-and-applications.md#gift-card-connectors)). A gift card often can't cover the full cart total; without a fallback method the shopper is stuck when the balance falls short. This is a configuration requirement, not a nice-to-have.

## Gift card connectors are consumed by Checkout

Unlike a raw payment connector (which you can wire into a custom storefront with no Checkout product), the gift card flow is designed around commercetools **Checkout**: Checkout renders the gift-card Payment Integration, drives balance/redeem through the enabler+processor, emits [gift card Messages](https://docs.commercetools.com/checkout/messages.md#gift-card-messages) (`gift_card_balance_*`, `gift_card_redeem_*`) you subscribe to via the [Browser SDK](https://docs.commercetools.com/checkout/browser-sdk.md), and drives post-order operations (refund/reverse) through the [Payment Intents API](https://docs.commercetools.com/checkout/payment-intents-api.md). If your team is wiring the *storefront* side of that (rendering the integration, reacting to gift card messages), that's the [commercetools-checkout](../../../commercetools-checkout/SKILL.md) skill; **this** sub-area is the connector behind it.

## Workflow

When integrating gift cards, follow these steps in order. The heart is **Step 1 → Step 1.5 → Step 2 → Step 3** (requirements → use/customize/build? → config → the two apps).

<!-- ct:docs-search:begin -->
### Step 0 — Gather context (run first)

Gather the latest verified documentation as your primary grounding for this sub-area. You must run this before designing anything here; the commercetools Knowledge MCP covers everything the script does not:

```bash
node scripts/docs-search.mjs \
  --query "<gift card terms from the user's request, e.g. 'gift card connector checkout balance redeem payment method'>" \
  --app-name "<host app: claude-code, claude-chat, cursor, codex, copilot — or the host's own name>" \
  --model "<current-model>" \
  --limit 10
```
<!-- ct:docs-search:end -->

(Run it from the `commercetools-integrations` skill root.) Use its output as primary grounding. Use this script rather than the commercetools Knowledge MCP tools while working in this skill; `https://docs.commercetools.com/checkout/connectors-and-applications` is good further reading.

### Step 1 — Extract requirements (before any config or code)

Gift card behavior is downstream of business facts, and the wrong default silently produces a broken checkout. Extract these first; each maps to a config key in Step 2 or a rung in Step 1.5. Ask the user (don't assume):

1. **Which gift card system, and why?** A dedicated gift-card/loyalty platform (e.g. Voucherify), an in-house ledger, or a store-credit service. Do they already have an account + API credentials?
2. **Is there a public connector for it?** Voucherify has one; most systems don't. This decides configure-vs-build (Step 1.5) and changes the effort estimate — say it early.
3. **Region and project?** e.g. `europe-west1.gcp`, project `my-project` — the CT API/Auth/Session hosts and JWKS/issuer config are region-specific.
4. **Which fallback payment method(s)?** The gift card integration is configured alongside another Payment Integration (PSP). Which one, and is it already deployed? (Non-negotiable — see the rule above.)
5. **Currency handling?** A single connector deployment is typically scoped to one currency; a multi-currency storefront may need multiple deployments or a system that handles conversion. Confirm the currencies in scope.
6. **Partial + multiple cards?** Should one cart accept multiple gift cards, and combine a card with a PSP payment for the remainder? (Usually yes — confirm the system supports partial redemption.)
7. **Post-order operations?** On cancellation/return, should redeemed value be **refunded/reversed** back to the card? → drives whether you implement the Payment Intents `refundPayment`/`reversePayment` operations, not just balance+redeem.
8. **Anything special or non-standard? (always ask — open-ended)** Expiry rules, per-transaction caps, PIN/security-code entry, fraud checks, combining with discount codes, B2B store credit, or a specific gift-card account/program id. Capture each as its own requirement line; **don't force it into a slot above.**

Write these as a short requirements block and **confirm with the user** before deriving config. Each special requirement feeds the Step 1.5 fit-check (it may push "configure" → "fork" or "build"). If the user surfaces nothing special, a sane default is: system chosen → one currency → partial + multiple cards on → paired with an existing PSP integration → balance + redeem + refund → and say so explicitly.

### Step 1.5 — Use a public connector, customize one, or build a new one? (decide before wiring or building)

This is the core routing decision the user asked for. With the requirements in hand, answer: **does a connector that already does this exist for this gift card system?** Don't answer from memory — the marketplace changes. Check **live** data (the [Connect marketplace](https://docs.commercetools.com/merchant-center/connect.md) + the gift-card docs, via the `docs-search` script), and **name the connector + version** you checked.

Then walk the **ladder** — stop at the first rung that fits, because each later one is more to build and maintain:

1. **Use a public connector directly** → if a Public Connector of type Gift Cards covers the system (e.g. Voucherify) or you just need a proof of concept (the **sample gift card connector** — see below), install + configure it (Step 2). Don't build.
2. **Public connector, gap looks like a capability** → prove it isn't **config** first. Many "missing" behaviors (currency, which operations are enabled, fallback pairing) are `connect.yaml` values or Merchant Center Payment Integration settings → back to rung 1.
3. **Customize/fork a connector's code** → genuine gap config can't close **and** an open-source connector exists for the system → fork it, add only the delta, deploy as an Organization connector. Don't rebuild a working one.
4. **Build a new one from the template** → no connector for the system → build from the [gift card integration template](https://github.com/commercetools/connect-giftcard-integration-template). The template ships both apps with the Connect + session/JWT plumbing done; you implement the calls to *your* gift card service and the mapping. This is the common case.

The **sample gift card connector** (installable from the marketplace) is for test/PoC only — it simulates payments with codes like `Valid-10000-EUR` and makes no real payment ([docs](https://docs.commercetools.com/checkout/connectors-and-applications.md#sample-gift-card-connector)). Use it to validate the checkout wiring before a real system exists; it is not a production integration.

**Ask the user to choose the rung explicitly** once you have the live landscape — "install as-is" (including the sample connector for a PoC), "customize/fork it", and "build from the gift-card template" are materially different amounts of work, so give your recommendation and its reasoning, then let them decide. Record the decision, the rung, and the version in the requirements block. Details and the landscape table: [connector-selection.md](./connector-selection.md). Rungs 3–4 switch to the [commercetools-connect](../../../commercetools-connect/SKILL.md) skill for the build/stage/publish lifecycle, then return here.

### Step 2 — Derive the config from the requirements

Translate the Step 1 answers into concrete `connect.yaml` values for the chosen connector (or your own), with a one-line **why** for each. The mapping, the CT envelope keys, least-privilege scopes, and a worked example are in [config-from-requirements.md](./config-from-requirements.md). Key decisions that live here:

- The commercetools connection block (`CTP_PROJECT_KEY`, `CTP_AUTH_URL`, `CTP_API_URL`, `CTP_SESSION_URL`, `CTP_JWKS_URL`, `CTP_JWT_ISSUER`) — region-specific; the session/JWKS/issuer values are what let the processor validate Checkout sessions and Merchant Center JWTs.
- **Currency** config (one deployment ≈ one currency for the template/Voucherify) and the gift-card-system credentials.
- **Secured vs standard config** — the gift card system API secret and the CT client secret are `securedConfiguration`; URLs, currency, and behavioral toggles are `standardConfiguration`.
- The **API-client scopes** the connector needs (`manage_payments`, `manage_orders`, `view_sessions`, `view_api_clients`, `manage_checkout_payment_intents`, `introspect_oauth_tokens`).

### Step 3 — Build/verify the two apps (the main body of work), test-first

**Tests come before implementation.** The rules that make a gift card integration correct — balance and redeem being session-authenticated, redeem creating/updating the commercetools Payment idempotently, partial redemption leaving a remainder for the fallback method, refund/reverse going through the Payment Intents route — are invisible at the call site and tedious to reproduce by hand. Each is one cheap assertion. Write the test first.

Read [giftcard-contract.md](./giftcard-contract.md) and build, in order — **test first for each**:

1. **Processor — balance + redeem** (session-authenticated): `POST /balance` (`{ code }`) checks the gift card system and reports the balance and whether it covers the cart; `POST /redeem` (`{ code, redeemAmount }`) redeems value against the system and records it on the commercetools Payment. Handle insufficient balance (partial redemption, remainder to the fallback method) and zero balance.
2. **Processor — post-order operations** (`POST /payment-intents/:id`, JWT/OAuth, `manage_checkout_payment_intents`): implement `modifyPayment` for the operations in scope (refund, reverse/rollback). Driven by the [Payment Intents API](https://docs.commercetools.com/checkout/payment-intents-api.md), not by the enabler.
3. **Enabler** — the frontend touchpoint that renders the gift-card input and calls the processor with the session. Thin slice; contract is in [giftcard-contract.md](./giftcard-contract.md).

**Mock the outbound boundary** (the gift card system, the CT APIs) and assert on what your code *decided* — which endpoint, what body, what it did with the response. The suite must run with zero deployment and zero secrets. What to assert/mock per app is in [giftcard-contract.md](./giftcard-contract.md).

### Step 4 — Verify the round trip

Don't declare done until a real gift card leaves a trace: a balance check returns the correct amount, a redeem creates a commercetools **Payment** with a transaction, the remainder (if any) is covered by the fallback method, and — if in scope — a refund/reverse through the Payment Intents API returns value to the card. See [verification.md](./verification.md), which also covers the traps that look like bugs: the **sample connector only simulates** (nothing is really redeemed), and a gift card integration **shown alone with no fallback** looks broken when the balance is short.

Adding another gift card system later means adding a sibling provider note and extending the selection table — the two-app architecture, the contract, and the flow do not change.
