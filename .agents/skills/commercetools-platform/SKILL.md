# commercetools TypeScript SDK

Foundational patterns for connecting to the commercetools API from TypeScript. These patterns are project-type agnostic — they apply whether you are building a Next.js storefront, a serverless function, or a CLI script.

## Workflow

When this skill is invoked, always follow these steps:

1. <!-- ct:docs-search:begin -->
   **Docs search (required, run first)** — The first time you use this skill in a session you must run this before answering. It gathers the latest verified documentation as your primary grounding, filtered to the products this skill covers. Use this script for documentation search while working with this skill; the Knowledge MCP covers everything else. Always confirm details against retrieved documentation rather than the skill text alone:

   ```bash
   node scripts/docs-search.mjs \
     --query "<extract key terms from user's question>" \
     --app-name "<host app: claude-code, claude-chat, cursor, codex, copilot — or the host's own name>" \
     --model "<current-model>" \
     --limit 10
   ```
   <!-- ct:docs-search:end -->

2. **Combine with skill references** — Cross-reference the analysis output with local references in `./references/` for complete context.

3. **Provide implementation guidance** — Synthesize the documentation with the specific integration mode the user is targeting.

### Optional scripts

**Fetch GraphQL schema** — Run this when you need context about a commercetools GraphQL query or mutation — for example, to inspect a resource's fields, types, and available operations before writing a query, or to verify a GraphQL query/mutation you have just generated against the real schema. It fetches the partial GraphQL SDL for a single commercetools resource:
   ```bash
   node scripts/graphql-schemata.mjs \
     --resource-name "<commercetools resource, e.g. Cart, Product, Order>" \
     --app-name "<host app: claude-code, claude-chat, cursor, codex, copilot — or the host's own name>" \
     --model "<current-model>"
   ```
   The output is the GraphQL SDL for that resource. If the resource name is not recognized, the script prints the list of valid resource names — pick the correct one and re-run. **Note:** the SDL may contain *stubbed types* — referenced resources rendered as stubs, with their real type name given in a comment. Fetch any you need separately by re-running this script with that type name as `--resource-name`.

**Fetch OpenAPI (REST) schema** — Run this when you need context about a commercetools REST endpoint, request/response payload, or update action — for example, to inspect a resource's REST operations before constructing a request, or to verify a REST request/payload you have just generated against the real specification. It fetches the partial OpenAPI specification for a single commercetools resource:
   ```bash
   node scripts/openApi-schemata.mjs \
     --resource-name "<commercetools resource, e.g. api-Cart-write, api-Customer-read, checkout-Application>" \
     --app-name "<host app: claude-code, claude-chat, cursor, codex, copilot — or the host's own name>" \
     --model "<current-model>"
   ```
   The output is the OpenAPI specification (YAML) for that resource. REST resources use a read/write-split naming form (e.g. `api-Cart-read`, `api-Cart-write`). If the resource name is not recognized, the script prints the list of valid resource names — pick the correct one and re-run. **Note:** the spec does not include reference-expansion schemas — fetch a referenced resource's schema separately by re-running this script with that resource as `--resource-name`.

## SDK Setup

See [sdk-setup.md](./references/sdk-setup.md) for:
- Package installation (`@commercetools/platform-sdk` + `@commercetools/ts-client`)
- `ClientBuilder` singleton with Client Credentials flow
- Required environment variables and auth URLs by region
- Required API client scopes

## Product Search API

See [product-search.md](./references/product-search.md) for:
- Official docs and why the legacy `productProjections` search is deprecated
- Full-text + filter + sort + facets example
- Category filter, SKU lookup, price selection, discount expansion, BOPIS channel filtering
