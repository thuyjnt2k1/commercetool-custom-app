# Tax connector — integrate an external tax service (backend-focused)

This is the **tax integration sub-area** of [commercetools-connect](../../../SKILL.md): you need an external tax engine to compute (and file) tax on carts and orders, and you'll do it with a Connect connector. For the deep, type-agnostic build/publish/certify lifecycle and the production-readiness gate, that's the parent connect skill; this sub-area owns the tax-specific shape end to end — from "is there a connector already?" through configuring, forking, or building one.

A tax integration is **two jobs**, and the connector is **two applications** that mirror them:

- **tax-calculator** (a `service` registered as a **cart API Extension**) — the **calculate** half. On cart changes, commercetools calls it *synchronously*; it asks the tax engine for the tax on the current cart and returns cart update actions that put the tax onto the cart. This is a **quote** — nothing is filed.
- **order-syncer** (an `event` driven by an **OrderCreated Subscription**) — the **record** half. After an order is placed, it *asynchronously* records the finalized order as a transaction in the tax engine (for reporting/filing), and — for a full integration — commits/voids/refunds as the order's lifecycle changes.

This two-app split is not incidental: it's the architecture the official [tax integration template](https://docs.commercetools.com/connect/templates/tax-integration.md) ships, the one the certified Avalara connector implements, and the one the [tax integration tutorial](https://docs.commercetools.com/tutorials/tax-integration.md) documents. Calculation must be synchronous (it blocks the cart so the shopper sees correct tax); recording must be asynchronous (filing must not block or fail checkout).

> **Calculation vs. recording is the mistake to internalize first.** "Why don't my transactions show up in the tax provider's dashboard?" is almost always because only the *calculator* is wired: the calculate API stores nothing; only the *record* API (the order-syncer) persists a transaction. They are different endpoints on the provider and different Connect apps here.

## Workflow

When integrating tax, follow these steps in order. The heart is **Step 1 → Step 1.5 → Step 2 → Step 4** (requirements → is a certified connector enough? → config → the two apps).

<!-- ct:docs-search:begin -->
### Step 0 — Gather context (run first)

Gather the latest verified documentation as your primary grounding for this sub-area. You must run this before designing anything here; the commercetools Knowledge MCP covers everything the script does not:

```bash
node scripts/docs-search.mjs \
  --query "<tax terms from the user's request, e.g. 'tax connector external tax API extension cart tax order sync'>" \
  --app-name "<host app: claude-code, claude-chat, cursor, codex, copilot — or the host's own name>" \
  --model "<current-model>" \
  --limit 10
```
<!-- ct:docs-search:end -->

(Run it from the `commercetools-connect` skill root.) Use its output as primary grounding. Use this script rather than the commercetools Knowledge MCP tools while working in this skill; `https://docs.commercetools.com/tutorials/tax-integration` is good further reading.

### Step 1 — Extract requirements (before any config or code)

Tax behavior is downstream of business facts, and the wrong default silently produces wrong or missing tax. Extract these first; each maps to a config key in Step 2 or a rung in Step 1.5. Ask the user (don't assume):

1. **Which tax engine, and why?** Avalara/Vertex (enterprise US sales tax + global, compliance/filing), TaxJar (simpler US sales tax), or another. Do they already have an account + credentials?
2. **Where do they have nexus / an obligation to collect?** Which countries/states. This decides which destinations produce non-zero tax and is a frequent "why is tax zero?" cause (see [verification.md](./verification.md)).
3. **Region and project?** e.g. `europe-west1.gcp`, project `my-project` — the API host and config are region-specific.
4. **Do they need transaction recording / filing, or just calculation at checkout?** Calculation-only (rare) is one app; recording (the norm for compliance) needs the order-syncer too. → decides whether you build one app or two.
5. **Order lifecycle beyond creation?** Should cancellations **void** the filed transaction and returns **refund** it? → drives whether the syncer subscribes to `OrderStateChanged`/return messages, not just `OrderCreated`.
6. **Product tax categories / codes?** Are products taxed differently (clothing, food, digital, luxury)? Where is the tax code stored — a Product attribute, a Tax Category, or a Custom Field? → drives the tax-code mapping in the calculator.
7. **Tax-exempt buyers?** B2B/non-profit/government exemptions, exemption certificates or entity-use codes → stored on the Customer (Custom Field) and passed through.
8. **B2B / included-in-price / rounding needs?** VAT-inclusive pricing (`includedInPrice`), `taxCalculationMode` (LineItem vs UnitPrice), `taxRoundingMode`.
9. **Anything special or non-standard? (always ask — open-ended)** Marketplace/multi-seller, cross-border/customs, multi-currency, address validation, invoicing, or a specific engine account/company code. Capture each as its own requirement line; **don't force it into a slot above.**

Write these as a short requirements block and **confirm with the user** before deriving config. Each special requirement feeds the Step 1.5 fit-check (it may push "configure" → "fork" or "custom"). If the user surfaces nothing special, a sane default is: engine chosen → destination has nexus → calculation **and** recording → `ExternalAmount` tax mode → tax code from a Product attribute → and say so explicitly.

### Step 1.5 — Is a certified connector enough? (decide before wiring or building)

With the requirements in hand, answer the question the rest of the flow assumes: **does a connector that already does this exist for this engine?** Don't answer from memory — the marketplace changes. Check **live** data (the Connect marketplace + the tax-integration docs, via the `docs-search` script), and **name the connector + version** you checked. The tax landscape as of writing: **Avalara and Vertex have certified public connectors; TaxJar does not** (build from template). See [connector-selection.md](./connector-selection.md).

Then walk the **ladder** — stop at the first rung that fits, because each later one is more to build and maintain:

1. **Public connector covers everything** → install + configure (Step 2). Don't build. Installing it (CLI auth, scopes, `deployment create`) is the parent skill's [deployment-installation.md](../../deployment-installation.md); it is **not** the `connectorstaged` flow.
2. **Supported engine, gap looks like a capability** → prove it isn't **config** first. Most "missing" behaviors (which order states commit/void, tax-code source, exemptions) are `connect.yaml` values or Merchant Center settings → back to rung 1. See [config-from-requirements.md](./config-from-requirements.md).
3. **Supported engine, genuine gap config can't close** → **fork/extend the public connector** (Avalara's is open source; see [avalara.md](./avalara.md)); add only the delta and deploy as an Organization connector. Don't rebuild a working, maintained connector. Hand off to [commercetools-connect](../../../SKILL.md) for the build/publish lifecycle.
4. **No public connector for the engine at all (e.g. TaxJar)** → build from the [tax integration template](https://docs.commercetools.com/connect/templates/tax-integration.md). The template ships both apps as stubs; you implement the engine calls and the mapping. The exact contract, gotchas, and a worked engine are in [tax-contract.md](./tax-contract.md) and [avalara.md](./avalara.md) (with TaxJar as the from-scratch example). The [template docs](https://docs.commercetools.com/connect/templates/tax-integration.md) state it is for development purposes and needs further customization before production use, so read and test-drive the generated lifecycle scripts and validators rather than treating them as production-ready ([connect-cli.md](../../connect-cli.md), Step 2).

**Ask the user to choose the rung explicitly** once you have the live landscape — "install the certified connector as-is", "fork it", and "build both apps from the tax-integration template" are materially different amounts of work, so give your recommendation and its reasoning, then let them decide. Record the decision, the rung, and the version in the requirements block.

### Step 2 — Derive the config from the requirements

Translate the Step 1 answers into concrete `connect.yaml` values for the chosen connector (or your own), with a one-line **why** for each. The mapping and the provider-specific key names/defaults are in [config-from-requirements.md](./config-from-requirements.md) and [avalara.md](./avalara.md). Key decisions that live here:

- **Tax mode: `ExternalAmount` (recommended) vs `External`.** `ExternalAmount` means the engine's exact amounts are authoritative — no re-derivation, no rounding drift between what's filed and what's shown. `External` has commercetools compute from a rate you supply. The docs and the certified connector both prefer `ExternalAmount`. → [config-from-requirements.md](./config-from-requirements.md#tax-mode).
- **API-client scopes** the connector needs — declare them in `inheritAs.apiClient.scopes` so Connect provisions a least-privilege client (`manage_extensions`, `manage_subscriptions`, `view_orders`), rather than hand-supplying `CTP_CLIENT_ID/SECRET`.
- **Secured vs standard config** — the engine API token/credentials are `securedConfiguration`; region and behavioral toggles are `standardConfiguration`.

### Step 3 — The extension trigger & call-reduction (reference)

The API Extension is what makes the calculator fire. External tax engines bill per call and rate-limit, so the trigger **condition** matters: fire only when the cart can actually be taxed and is worth taxing (`taxMode="ExternalAmount"`, a shipping address is set, line items exist), and consider hashing the cart to skip redundant calls. Full contract and the call-reduction pattern: [tax-contract.md](./tax-contract.md).

### Step 4 — Build/verify the two apps (the main body of work), test-first

**Tests come before implementation.** The rules that make a tax integration correct — the extension returning `200`/`201` (not `202`), taxing *shipping and custom line items* too (or the Order can't be created in `ExternalAmount` mode), idempotent recording, committing only on the right order states — are invisible at the call site and tedious to reproduce by hand. Each is one cheap assertion. Write the test first.

Read [tax-contract.md](./tax-contract.md) and build, in order — **test first for each**:

1. **Calculator (API Extension)** — map cart → engine request; call the engine's *calculate* API; map the response to `setLineItemTaxAmount` + `setCustomLineItemTaxAmount` + `setShippingMethodTaxAmount` + `setCartTotalTax` (and `changeTaxMode` if you own that); respond `200` fast; decide fail-open vs fail-closed.
2. **Order-syncer (Subscription)** — on `OrderCreated`, re-fetch the Order by id, map it to the engine's *record/commit* transaction API, POST idempotently (stable `transaction_id` = order id). For a full integration, also handle cancel→void and return→refund.

**Mock the outbound boundary** (the tax engine, the CT APIs) and assert on what your code *decided* — which endpoint, what body, what it did with the response. The suite must run with zero deployment and zero secrets. What to assert/mock per app is in [tax-contract.md](./tax-contract.md).

### Step 5 — Verify the round trip

Don't declare done until a real cart carries engine-computed tax and a real order shows up as a transaction. The **`taxedPrice`** appears on the cart (it's absent until the extension is registered and firing), and — with a **live** engine account whose **nexus** covers the destination — a transaction is recorded. See [verification.md](./verification.md), which also covers the two traps that make people think it's broken when it isn't: **sandbox accounts often don't persist transactions**, and **an engine returns zero tax where you have no nexus.**

- [ ] `inheritAs.apiClient.scopes` = `manage_extensions`, `manage_subscriptions`, `view_orders` (least-privilege)
- [ ] Engine credentials in `securedConfiguration`; region/toggles in `standardConfiguration`

The two apps (build test-first — do not write a function body before its red test)
- [ ] Calculator returns `200`/`201` (never `202`); taxes line items **and custom line items and shipping**; `changeTaxMode` if it owns the mode
- [ ] Extension trigger conditioned to reduce engine calls (mode set, address present, non-empty)

Verification
- [ ] `taxedPrice` present on the cart after a cart update (extension registered + firing)
- [ ] With a live account whose nexus covers the destination, a transaction is recorded
- [ ] Understood: sandbox may not persist transactions; zero tax at a no-nexus destination is correct, not a bug
