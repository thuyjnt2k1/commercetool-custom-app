# Search connector — outbound catalog indexing (build or integrate)

This is the **search integration sub-area** of [commercetools-connect](../../../SKILL.md): getting the product catalog *out* of commercetools and into an external search / product-discovery engine (Algolia, Constructor, Bloomreach Discovery, Coveo, Elasticsearch, Typesense, Meilisearch, or a bespoke engine) so a storefront can query it. The build-side platform contracts (service/event/job semantics, `connect.yaml`, lifecycle scripts, testing, deploy) are the parent connect skill; this sub-area owns the **search-specific job end to end** — from "do you even need an external engine?" through configuring, forking, or building the connector, to the data mapping and sync architecture that keep the index correct.

**Direction.** A search connector is **commercetools → external engine** (commercetools is the source of truth for the catalog; the engine holds a denormalized copy optimized for query). This is the *outbound* direction — the same as the [product-export template](https://docs.commercetools.com/connect/templates/product-export.md), and the opposite of the inbound [PIM](../pim/overview.md) / [CRM](../crm/overview.md) sub-areas. commercetools does not read back from the engine.

**Two things a search connector is *not*.** It does **not** touch the Cart/Order hot path — there is **no API Extension** and no synchronous call at checkout — and there is no browser/enabler contract; it is pure backend data movement (a `service`/`job` full load plus an `event`/`job` that keeps it fresh), so this whole sub-area is server-side. The engine's **relevance configuration** (searchable fields, ranking, synonyms, merchandising rules, A/B tests) is owned *in the engine*, not here — the connector only feeds it correct, current data.

## Workflow

Follow these steps in order. The heart is **Step 1.4 (native gate) → Step 2 (data mapping) → Step 3 (the two apps)** — ruling out native search can end the project on day one, and the mapping is where an external index stays correct or silently rots.

<!-- ct:docs-search:begin -->
### Step 0 — Gather context (run first)

Gather the latest verified documentation as your primary grounding for this sub-area. You must run this before designing anything here; the commercetools Knowledge MCP covers everything the script does not:

```bash
node scripts/docs-search.mjs \
  --query "<search terms from the request, e.g. 'integrate external search product export product projections staged product search subscriptions'>" \
  --app-name "<host app: claude-code, claude-chat, cursor, codex, copilot — or the host's own name>" \
  --model "<current-model>" \
  --limit 10
```
<!-- ct:docs-search:end -->

(Run it from the `commercetools-connect` skill root, where `scripts/docs-search.mjs` lives.) The load-bearing docs for this sub-area are the two tutorials — [Integrate external search](https://docs.commercetools.com/tutorials/search-integration.md) (whole-catalog) and [Populate a Store-specific external search](https://docs.commercetools.com/tutorials/store-specific-external-search.md) (Store/Product-Selection-scoped) — the [Product export template](https://docs.commercetools.com/connect/templates/product-export.md) (the official scaffold), and, for the native gate, the [Storefront search overview](https://docs.commercetools.com/api/storefront-search-overview.md). Read them. Use this script rather than the commercetools Knowledge MCP tools while working in this skill: it queries the same index, with this skill's product filters applied.

### Step 1 — Extract requirements (before any config or code)

The architecture is downstream of a handful of answers. Ask the user — don't assume:

1. **Which engine, and why this one over native?** Algolia, Constructor, Bloomreach, Coveo, Elasticsearch/OpenSearch, Typesense, Meilisearch, or undecided. Do they already have an account + API keys? If undecided, Step 1.4 may end at rung 0 (native).
2. **What can native Product Search *not* do?** Name the specific need — merchandising/curation, synonyms and query rules, recommendations, search analytics, A/B testing, learned ranking, or a headless engine the front end already talks to. "Typo-tolerant full-text with facets" is **native** ([storefront-search-overview](https://docs.commercetools.com/api/storefront-search-overview.md)) — say so (Step 1.4).
3. **Whole-catalog or Store-specific?** One global index, or a Store-scoped index driven by [Product Selections](https://docs.commercetools.com/api/projects/product-selections.md) / [Product Tailoring](https://docs.commercetools.com/api/projects/product-tailoring.md)? This picks the tutorial and the projection endpoint (Step 3).
4. **Which locales?** Drives index-per-locale vs per-locale fields (`localeProjection`).
5. **Which price context(s)?** Currency, country, Customer Group, Channel — a record can't hold every combination; you must pick (Step 2).
6. **Does availability/inventory belong in the index?** High-churn and eventually consistent — usually a deliberate *no* or a coarse flag, never the live stock system of record.
7. **Record granularity — product-level or variant-level?** A UX decision (one hit per product vs one per variant) that shapes the whole document.
8. **Catalog volume and cadence.** Size drives batch/pagination; real-time correctness → event-driven, large periodic rebuilds → scheduled `job`.
9. **Anything special? (always ask — open-ended)** B2B/scoped assortments, multi-currency budgets, category-tree depth, staged-vs-published rules, GDPR in product data. Capture each as its own requirement line; don't force it into a slot above.

Write these as a short requirements block and **confirm with the user** before choosing an approach.

### Step 1.4 — Rung 0: is native search enough? (STRONG — rule it out first)

commercetools ships its **own** search: [Product Search](https://docs.commercetools.com/api/projects/product-search.md) and [Product Projection Search](https://docs.commercetools.com/api/projects/product-projection-search.md) cover full-text, fuzzy/prefix/wildcard matching, faceting, and price/Store/Product-Selection scoping ([storefront-search-overview](https://docs.commercetools.com/api/storefront-search-overview.md); Product Search reached general availability in June 2024, with facets GA in October 2025 — [Use Product Search](https://docs.commercetools.com/learning-implement-product-discovery-and-presentation/build-product-listing-pages/use-product-search.md)). An external engine is a **standing indexing pipeline to own, secure, and pay for**, plus an eventual-consistency lag and an operational dependency on the cart-adjacent PLP.

**Stop at rung 0** when the requirement is basic PLP/search — full-text, typo tolerance, facets, sort, price/Store scoping. Say so plainly and stop; do not build a connector for what the platform already does. **Go past rung 0** only when a stated need genuinely exceeds native: visual/AI merchandising and curation, synonym/redirect rule sets, recommendations, search analytics dashboards, A/B testing, learned/personalized ranking, or a discovery engine the front end is already committed to. The full gate and the native-capability table are in [connector-selection.md](./connector-selection.md).

### Step 1.5 — Native, use, fork, or build?

Once native is ruled out, establish the landscape from **live** marketplace data — use a public connector, fork one, or scaffold from the Product export template — and watch the hosted-integration trap (an engine's own dashboard-configured integration is not a deployable Connect connector). **Present all three paths to the user with a recommendation and its reasoning, then let them choose** — "install the public connector", "fork it", and "build from the template" are materially different amounts of work and the choice is theirs, not yours. Do this even when the user named an engine they already run; naming the engine settles the *destination*, not the *path*. Full procedure and fit table: [connector-selection.md](./connector-selection.md).

### Step 2 — Data mapping (the heart)

Whether you configure a connector or build one, the make-or-break work is mapping a commercetools [Product Projection](https://docs.commercetools.com/api/projects/productProjections.md) onto a flat, denormalized search document: id/`objectID` keying, record granularity, the price-context explosion, localization, category denormalization, Store assortment, and where (if anywhere) availability belongs. This is [data-mapping.md](./data-mapping.md). Get it wrong and the index drifts no matter how good the plumbing is.

### Step 3 — Sync architecture (the two apps)

A search integration is **two jobs**, mirrored by two apps: a **full ingestion** (`service` on-demand trigger or scheduled `job`) that reindexes the whole catalog atomically, and an **incremental updater** (`event` on product/store/selection Subscriptions, or a polling `job`) that keeps it fresh. The contract for each, and the pitfall catalog, is [search-contract.md](./search-contract.md); the `connect.yaml` config derived from Step 1 is [config-from-requirements.md](./config-from-requirements.md). The official scaffold is the [Product export template](https://docs.commercetools.com/connect/templates/product-export.md).

### Step 4 — Deploy

Deploying a public or custom connector (CLI auth, scopes, `deployment create`, regions, certification) is the parent skill's [deployment-installation.md](../../deployment-installation.md).

### Step 5 — Verify the sync

Don't declare done until a real product change has flowed end to end: publish → the record appears in the index; unpublish/delete → it's gone; a full ingestion → counts match the published catalog; a re-run leaves the index unchanged. The checks and the traps that look like bugs but aren't (eventual-consistency lag, availability drift, a non-atomic rebuild) are in [verification.md](./verification.md).

This sub-area is **vendor-neutral by design** — the requirements, the native gate, the data-mapping method, and the two-app architecture are the same for any engine (Algolia, Constructor, Bloomreach, Elasticsearch, …). Don't add per-engine reference files: they duplicate [data-mapping.md](./data-mapping.md) and go stale on engine specifics. Instead, look the specific engine and any connector up **live** (marketplace + the engine's own SDK/docs, per [connector-selection.md](./connector-selection.md)) and apply the vendor-neutral mapping method to whatever index vocabulary you find.

Mapping + sync (the deliverables)
- [ ] Projection → flat document mapped; `objectID` keyed for idempotent upsert; price context and localization resolved → [data-mapping.md](./data-mapping.md)
- [ ] Full ingestion reindexes **atomically** and verifies counts; incremental updater is idempotent and **propagates deletions** → [search-contract.md](./search-contract.md)
